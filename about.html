                <b>Favorite animal: Snakes</b>

                <b>Favorite animal: Giraffes</b>
                When Joe was a child, he went to the Central Park Zoo and immediately fell in love with all of the animals he saw. He came to Stevens to major in Computer Science, but when he is old and retired, he wishes to own his own zoo.

            <p> 
                <b>Favorite animal: Sloths</b>
                4 years ago, Anthony came across an injured baby sloth lying in the middle of the road by his house. He decided it would be best to help that sloth recover so it can live a full and happy life. Today, that sloth is almost fully recovered and Anthony expects to release it back into the wild by the end of next year.

            <p> 
            <b>Favorite animal: Dogs</b>
                Brandon's best friend growing up was his dog. The saddest day of his life was leaving his dog behind to go to College, but Brandon keeps in touch by facetiming his dog every sunday night.
