            <p><strong><u>Puppies and things</u></strong> </p>
            <img src = "galleryphotos/pupper.jpg" alt = "Photo of animal 1">
            <p>Dogs have been a staple in human society for hundreds of years. Throughout history dogs have been a companion to men and women, and will continue to be. It is proven that humans do not deserve dogs due to their loyalty, friendship, and trust in us.</p>

        <div class = 'col-2'>
            <p><strong><u> Rabbits and such</u></strong></p>
            <img src = "galleryphotos/bunner.jpg" alt = "Photo of animal 2">
            <p>Rabbits have been prey to animals for too long! These cuddly creatures are too adorable to be hunted, and recently have been becoming household pets for many. Their diets consist of hay, assorted greens, and rabbit pellets. Fun fact: Carrots are actually unhealthy for rabbits!</p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'col-3'>
            <p><strong><u> Kittens and cuties</u></strong></p>
            <img src = "galleryphotos/kitty.jpg" alt = "Photo of animal 3">
            <p>Cats are apart of the feline family, but do not let them fool you! Despite the claws and sharp teeth, cats are just as cuddly and cute as the others. They enjoy climbing, hunting, being pet,  and laying in the most inconvenient places at the most inconvenient times.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'col-4'>
            <p><strong><u> Fun fun in the sun </u></strong></p>
            <img src = "galleryphotos/lizard.jpg" alt = "Photo of animal 4">
            <p>These rough skinned creatures may not be the cuddliest, but they sure are adorable! These creatures are cold blooded, which results in them needing to constantly sun bathe, or be under a heast lamp to survive. Lizards are also apart of a large family, with hundreds and hundreds of different types!</p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'col-5'>
            <p><strong><u>Under the sea</u></strong></p>
            <img src = "galleryphotos/dolphino.jpg" alt = "Photo of animal 5">
            <p>One of the most playful and intelligent sea animals to exist, the dolphin! With a brain size that rivals that of a human, dolphins are smart and cute. With their blow holes, they can even do tricks, such as blowing air bubbles, or just normal bubbles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = 'col-6'>
            <p><strong><u>Bonus animal!</u></strong></p>
        <img src = "galleryphotos/sloth.jpg" alt = "Photo of animal 6">
            <p>The laziest animal in the animal kingdom, sloths are the cutest sacks of potatoes you will ever see. They live in most rainforests and are awfully slow, but what they lack in speed, they make up in nails. Sloth's nails can reach approximate 2-3 inches! Unfortunately these guys are not the smartest, and have been known to grab their own arm as a tree branch, and fall to their death. Oh well!</p>
